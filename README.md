# pro2syntax
A syntax highlighter and autocomplete for .inp PRO2 files compatible with Notepad++

## How to install
First you will need Notepad++ of course. You can get it from [here](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/).  

Now you will need to download the latest release from this repository.  

Then you need to go to the folder where you installed Notepad++, usually `C:\Program Files\Notepad++\`  
Paste the `InpPRO2.xml` file inside the `autoCompletion` folder.  

Then you will need to go to the AppData folder, usually `C:\Users\<your_user>\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\`  
Paste `ipro2_lang.xml` into the `userDefineLangs` folder.  

And that's it, `.inp` files will automatically work, but you can just select the language from the language tab at the top.
